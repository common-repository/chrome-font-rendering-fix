= What this plugin does? =

Plugin includes only a simple javascript code which will be added to your webpage's <head> and that code displays local fonts when visitor loads the page until your external web fonts or @font-face fonts are being loaded. So user won't see blank screen. This problem happened with me while working on theme so it might be related to devs but still.
